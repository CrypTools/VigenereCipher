# VigenereCipher

## History and usage

The ***Vigenere cipher*** was named after **Blaise de Vigenère**. This **substitutiom cipher** was invented by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, however, the scheme was later ameliorated by Blaise de Vigenère in the 19th century, and therefore acquired its present name. The Vigenere cipher is similar to the **Caesar cipher**, but is harder to break (it resisted all attempts for around three centuries).
